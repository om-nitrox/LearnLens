# 📚 LearnLens – AI-Powered Image-to-Quiz Educational App

LearnLens is a powerful Flutter-based mobile application designed to convert images of textual content (from books, notes, or printouts) into structured learning formats like multiple-choice quizzes, flashcards, and concise summaries. It uses Google ML Kit for OCR and the Gemini API for AI-based content generation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The app enables students and self-learners to automate note revision and content recall by intelligently digitizing their study material into interactive learning aids.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📷 Capture or upload textbook images
- 🔍 OCR text extraction (handwritten and printed)
- 🧠 AI-generated summaries for quick review
- ❓ Auto-generated multiple-choice quizzes
- 🃏 Flip-based flashcards for active recall
- 🧪 Quiz scoring and feedback
- ✅ User-friendly Flutter UI

---

## 🧱 Architecture (in 5 lines)

1. The user selects or captures an image of study material.
2. Google ML Kit processes the image to extract raw text.
3. Text is fed into Gemini via prompt formatting.
4. Gemini responds with structured content: summary, quiz, flashcards.
5. Flutter widgets dynamically render this content for user interaction.
